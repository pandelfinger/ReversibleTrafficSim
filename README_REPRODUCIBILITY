"From Effects to Causes: Reversible Simulation and Reverse Exploration of Microscopic Traffic Models"

Instructions for replicating results
------------------------------------

--- System requirements ---

The original experiments were carried out on Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS.
Other recent Linux distributions are likely to work, but have not been tested.

To avoid swapping, the system should be equipped with >= 16 GiB RAM.

--- Install libfixmath ---

  cd libfixmath/libfixmath
  make
  sudo mkdir /usr/local/include/fixmath
  sudo cp *.h /usr/local/include/fixmath
  sudo cp *.a /usr/local/lib

--- Compile ---

From root of source folder: 'make' (with the -jN flag for N-way parallel compilation)

--- Run experiments ---

Run all experiments (takes multiple hours): './scripts/run_all_eval.sh'

Run specific experiment:
  - Figure 5: './scripts/garbage_bits/run_gb_evaluation.sh' 
  - Figure 6: './scripts/velocity_ins/run_velocity_ins_eval.sh'
  - Figure 7: './scripts/running_time/run_running_time_eval.pl'
  - Figure 8 and 9: './scripts/exploration/run_exploration_eval.sh'
  - Figure 11: './scripts/case_study/run_case_study_eval.sh'

The resulting plots can be found as .eps files in the root of the source folder.
