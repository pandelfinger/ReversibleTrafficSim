Instructions for replicating results
------------------------------------

--- Install libfixmath ---

  cd libfixmath/libfixmath
  make
  sudo mkdir /usr/local/include/fixmath
  sudo cp *.h /usr/local/include/fixmath
  sudo cp *.a /usr/local/lib

--- Compile ---

From root of source folder: 'make'

--- Run experiments ---

Run all experiments: './scripts/run_all_eval.sh'

Run specific experiment:
  - Figure 5: './scripts/garbage_bits/run_gb_evaluation.sh' 
  - Figure 6: './scripts/velocity_ins/run_velocity_ins_eval.sh'
  - Figure 7: './scripts/running_time/run_running_time_eval.pl'
  - Figure 8 and 9: './scripts/exploration/run_exploration_eval.sh'
  - Figure 11: './scripts/case_study/run_case_study_eval.sh'

The resulting plots can be found as .eps files in the root of the source folder.
